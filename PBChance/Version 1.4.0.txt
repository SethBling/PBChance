1.4.0
Update Notes V1.4.0 (2019-05-14)

1. Skipped Segments will no longer decrease the PB-chance. For example, if one segment contains 8 correct split times, 2 skips and 3 failures, the chance to select a failure is 3/10 instead of 3/8.

2. Speed optimation if "new segment times are more important than old ones" is set to 100. About 2x more combinations per second.
