1.4.1
Update Notes V1.4.1 (2019-05-28)

1. The calculation for a good pace. It calculates the average segment time, for all successfully simulated runs.

2. "Display Good Pace to PB" will display a good segment time, due to (1.).
  It's not a static information, so if a pb isn't possible, it can't display, and if it's only barely possible, the times will be going harder to beat.
  If you want to display the total time, check "Total time instead of Segment Time".

3. You can make a data-table of a complete run based on (1.). Go into the settings and scroll down. The table will be updated automatically, however you can click on "Refresh List" for a more accurate result.
  It will display the "Goal Time" (see 1.) in total and separately by the segments. In addition, it displays the best possible time, you can compare to this.
  So, if you want to beat a certain pb-time, you can also adjust the setting "Time difference" for this, to shift the Goal PB Time what you want.

4. New random information "Good pace to PB" and "Worth to continue".
