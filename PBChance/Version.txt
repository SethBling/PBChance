1.4.0                
Update Notes V1.4.0 (2019-05-14)

1. About two times faster calculation, if the setting "Newer segment times are more important than old ones" is set to 100.

2. Skipped Segments will no longer decrease the PB-chance. For example, if one segment contains 8 correct split times, 2 skips and 3 failures, the chance to select a failure is 3/13 instead of 3/11.

3. No live calculations in segment two have been fixed.


Update Notes V1.3.9b (2019-03-31)

1. Remaining Combinations now displays the result as an advertised number. For example, "1.2 E+057" is now called "1.2 Octodecillion E57". Up to 308 digits are supported.

2. If "Display odds (1 in N)" is checked, and you have a chance below 0.001% (live or split doesn't matter), the display will be in the following format "1 in n    0%", other than as described in point 3. So the decimal places are deleted in this case. If there aren't any successfully runs found, the display is simply "0%".


Update Notes V1.3.9 (2019-03-23)

1. If the Setting "Display every x seconds a random information... is set to 0, PBChance will display a information once per segment (in the middle).
E.G. Display every 0 seconds ... for 10 seconds, and the best segment time is 2:00, then it will display between 0:55 and 1:05 in this segment.

2. If a chance isn't possible, PBChance will not try to find a success run, and returns a 0% chance instantly. However, if it's possible, and PBChance can't find a success run within the sample size, PBChance will try to find a success run up to ten times longer than usual.

3. When you split at a chance below 0.01%, the display will be in following format: x in n. "x" is the count of successfully runs, "n" is the count of the sample size. The usual display "x.xx% (1 in n)" will be overridden for this.

4. The information "Times in this Segment" is changed to "Until here have Survived". It displays the survived runs at least to the last Segment, and how many attempts were necessary for it.

5. New information "Combinations per Second". It tells how many combinations the computer can check for a PB within a second. The formula is the sample size divided by the elapsed time (the whole function) multiplied by one second.


Update Notes V1.3.8 (2019-03-20)

1. Displaying 1 in x is now better to read (less decimal if not required).

2. The chance of survival also takes into account the setting "Consider at least X times" now. Thus, the survival chance to the end is definitely greater than 0%. For example, when this setting is 20, it takes into account the last 20 successfully runs (or as many as possible if there aren't 20 successfully runs available).

3. The setting "display survival chance" now displays a) the chance to survive in the current segment and b) the chance to survive to the end.

4. Check New Version will download the correct file now.

5. No more periodicaly displays between splits, with a distance of 10 seconds (before best time and after a split).
