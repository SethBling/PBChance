1.4.0
Update Notes V1.4.0 (2019-05-14)

1. Skipped Segments will no longer decrease the PB-chance. For example, if one segment contains 8 correct split times, 2 skips and 3 failures, the chance to select a failure is 3/10 instead of 3/8.

2. Speed optimation if "new segment times are more important than old ones" is set to 100. About 2x more combinations per second. 


Update Notes V1.3.8 (2019-03-20)

1. Displaying 1 in x is now better to read (less decimal if not required).

2. The chance of survival also takes into account the setting "Consider at least X times" now. Thus, the survival chance to the end is definitely greater than 0%. For example, when this setting is 20, it takes into account the last 20 successfully runs (or as many as possible if there aren't 20 successfully runs available).

3. The setting "display survival chance" now displays a) the chance to survive in the current segment and b) the chance to survive to the end.

4. Check New Version will download the correct file now.

5. No more periodicaly displays between splits, with a distance of 10 seconds (before best time and after a split).
